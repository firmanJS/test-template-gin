#### Checklist

- [x] Implement Dependency Injection (go-fx)
- [x] Routing (gin web framework)
- [x] Environment Files
- [x] Logging (file saving on `production`) [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap)
- [x] Middlewares (cors)
- [x] Database Setup (mysql)
- [x] Models Setup and Automigrate (gorm)
- [x] Repositories
- [x] Implementing Basic CRUD Operation
- [x] Authentication (JWT)
- [x] Migration
- [x] Dockerize Application with Debugging Support Enabled. Debugger runs at `5002`. Vs code configuration is at `.vscode/launch.json` which will attach debugger to remote application.
